## introduction

This is an introduction to the flutter language and ecosystem, and reasons to use flutter, and comparisons with similar technologies

[introduction](notes/introduction.md)


## getting started

Instructions on how to get started with flutter

- [getting started notes](notes/getting-started.md)

### hello world 

- hello world projects

  - [Hello World 01](projects/HelloWorld01)
  - [Hello World 02](projects/HelloWorld02)
  - [Hello World 03](projects/HelloWorld03)
  - [Hello World 04](projects/HelloWorld04)

## next steps

[Next Steps](notes/next-steps.md)

## scaffolding an app

[building an app with automatic scaffolding](notes/scaffolding.md)

## libraries

[libraries](notes/libraries.md)

## commands

here is a list of basic flutter commands to help you get started with working with flutter

[commands](notes/commands.md)

## regions

regions are very useful for tidying up code

[regions](notes/regions.md)

## navigation

Navigation uses tabs and drawers.

Route - tells us where to go from now

Stack - keeps track of navigation so far and how to go back

- navigation projects
  - [MultiPage01](Projects/MultiPage01)
  - [MultiPage02](Projects/MultiPage02)
  - [MultiPage03](Projects/MultiPage03)
  - [MultiPage04](Projects/MultiPage04) for a demonstration of code which navigates 4 pages and back.

## visibility

we can easily show and hide components

[visibility](notes/components.md#visibility)

## components 

Next we progress into building and using components

- [components notes](notes/components.md)

- components projects

  - [Simple Button Click](projects/ButtonClick01)
  - [Simple List View](projects/ListView01)
  - [Display Rows And Columns](projects/RowsAndColumns01)
  - [Display ListView Component](projects/ListView01)
  - [Display MultiPage Setup](projects/MultiPage01)

## unit tests

How to run unit tests

- [unit testing notes](notes/unit-testing.md)
- [unit test projects](projects/UnitTest01)

## api

Next we progress into reading data from an api into our app, and displaying it

- [api notes - reading and displaying api data](notes/api.md)

- api projects
  
  - [Obtain API data](projects/API01)
  - [sample app to display word pairs from an API](projects/WordPair01)

## all projects

A list of all projects is below
