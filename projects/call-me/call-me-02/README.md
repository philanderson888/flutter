# Flutter Contacts App

## Overview

Flutter version of the Contacts Manager app with Supabase integration. Features include:
- User authentication (signup, login, password reset)
- Contact management (CRUD operations)
- Random contact selection for calls/emails
- Contact frequency tracking

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Flutter and set up Android Studio
2. Create a new Flutter project:
   ```bash
   flutter create contacts_app
   cd contacts_app
   ```

3. Add required dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     supabase_flutter: ^2.3.4
     flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0
     go_router: ^13.2.0
     flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.10
     intl: ^0.19.0
     url_launcher: ^6.2.5
     flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0

   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_test:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_lints: ^3.0.1
   ```

4. Create `.env` file in project root:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

## Key Features Implementation

1. Environment Configuration
2. Supabase Integration
3. State Management with Riverpod
4. Routing with GoRouter
5. Contact Management
6. Authentication Flow
7. UI Components

Would you like me to start creating any specific part of this Flutter app? I can help with:

1. Setting up the basic project structure
2. Implementing the authentication flow
3. Creating the contacts management screens
4. Setting up Supabase integration
5. Building the UI components

Let me know which part you'd like to tackle first!


## completed project

I've implemented a complete contacts management system with:

Contact Service: Handles all Supabase database operations
Contacts Provider: Manages state and business logic
Contact Form Dialog: A reusable form for adding/editing contacts
Contacts Screen: The main screen with:
Beautiful list view of contacts
Add/Edit/Delete functionality
Random contact suggestion feature
Loading and error states
Empty state with a call-to-action
Phone and email integration
The UI is polished with:

Material Design 3 components
Proper loading states
Error handling
Confirmation dialogs
Beautiful animations
Intuitive layout
Would you like to test it out? You can now:

Add new contacts
Edit existing contacts
Delete contacts
Get random contact suggestions
Call or email contacts directly from the app

## app structure

The way we've structured the app follows several important patterns that make it maintainable and scalable:

Service Layer Pattern: The ContactService handles all Supabase interactions, keeping database logic isolated
State Management: Using Riverpod for predictable state management
Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data layers
Reusable Components: Like the ContactFormDialog that can be used for both adding and editing
Error Handling: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
Type Safety: Strong typing throughout the application
The authentication flow integrates seamlessly with the contact management features, and the Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase ensures that users can only access their own data.
