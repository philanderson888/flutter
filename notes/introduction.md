## about

it's a framework for building mobile apps and uses a programming language called `dart`

Google has invested heavily in `flutter` and it's good for building instant applications with one codebase which compiles natively to both `android` and `ios`, giving the user the native experience that they desire.  This is not just a web app running on top of the device, it's properly compiled down to native app code.
